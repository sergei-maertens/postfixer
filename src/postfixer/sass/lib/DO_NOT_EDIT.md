## Do not edit
Files in lib/ should be generic and are not intended to be edited for the purpose of customisation. If you need to alter
the behaviour of libraries please change the variables in "_settings.scss".

## Custom libraries
Custom libraries can be written but should cary the project name to distinguish them from the generic libraries.
